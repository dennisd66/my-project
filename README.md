# Database Schema for Concordance and Text Retrieval Services

This project provides a database schema to enable the provision of concordance and text retrieval services. The schema consists of two tables, `documents` and `concordances`, that store the information about the documents and their concordances.
Insert your documents data into the `documents` table and the concordance information into the `concordances` table. You can then use SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate the concordance and text data as needed.

## Usage
## Installation

Run the `database_schema.sql` file in your MySQL server to create the `documents` and `concordances` tables.
